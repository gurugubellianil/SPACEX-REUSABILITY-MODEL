# SPACEX REUSABILITY MODEL | Predictive Insights on the Reusability of Falcon 9 First Stages
To train a machine learning model and use the public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse its first stage.

Predicting if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

**EDA** - Collecting data on the Falcon 9 first-stage landings by using a RESTful API and web scraping. Also convert the data into a dataframe and then perform some data wrangling.

**Interactive Visual Analytics** - Building a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash and then building an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

**Predictive Analysis** - Using machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. Split the data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then finding the method that performs best using test data.

**Presenting Data-Driven Insights** - Compile all of these activities into one place and deliver the data-driven insights to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully.
